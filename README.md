Project Structure:

-'Docs' folder contains GDD/TDD and other documentation of plans regarding the engine.

-'Assets' folder may contain 2D art, 3D models, sfx, and bgm files

-'Source' folder only holds scripts (eg. .cpp and .h). Do NOT put .dll or .exe files.

-'Test' folder are for test scripts and logs

-'Blue Rapsol Engine' is for the release build. This is where executables and DLLs go. Data files go in sub folder 'Data'

Note: You will notice .blank files within each folder. This is just so git will track them for the repository. Git does not track empty folders.
